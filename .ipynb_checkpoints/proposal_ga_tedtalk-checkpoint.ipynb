Issues that I anticipate are building a model that acknowldges all the tag featurs. I chose this topic because I have always been facincated by Ted Talks and hope to give one some day. \n",

    "TED is a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas, usually in the form of short, powerful talks. TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged, and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 110 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.(https://www.ted.com/)"
