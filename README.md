## Predicting Ted Talks Views	

Ted Talks are popular because they are engaging and they have branded themselves as having 'ideas worth spreading'.
The presentation style has lead to millions watching.
I am planning to predict views of ted talks based on features like tags, duration, number of speakers, and comments.
I am using Kaggle's Ted Talk dataset.Issues that I anticipate are building a model that acknowledges all the tag feature.
I chose this topic because I have always been fascinated by Ted Talks and hope to give one someday.

## Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/ted-talks/data 
TED is a nonpartisan nonprofit devoted to spreading ideas,
usually in the form of short, powerful talks.TED began in 1984 as a conference where Technology, Entertainment and Design converged,and today covers almost all topics — from science to business to global issues — in more than 110 languages. Meanwhile, independently run TEDx events help share ideas in communities around the world.(https://www.ted.com/)
